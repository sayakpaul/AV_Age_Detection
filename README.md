The repository contains my submission towards this Hackathon problem by Analytics Vidhya: https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-age-detection/

I didn't upload the dataset because of its volume. It can be found using the above-mentioned link. 

I used Floydhub Resource for running my model.
